* GitPod - used to edit the website.
* HTML5 - provides structure and content for the website.
* CSS - provides the styling.
* Javascript - provides the interactivity.

## Wireframes

## Design

* ### Color Scheme
    
   * The colour scheme chosen was based on a calming but playful feeling that entices the player to continue playing. 
   * The main colors were three pieces that went in the white, blue and gray direction. And then green, red and gray were used for the game results.

* ### Typography 

    * The font chosen was 'Oswald 300' for the whole page.

    * The chosen font gave the heading and the body a bold and visible text.

## Testing

* Rock Paper Scissor has been tested for validation. The codes has been run through the WC3 HTML Validator, WC3 CSS Validator, JShint. The tests images below are from HTML-Validator and CSS-Validator:

* The JSHint validator results showed that there were two semi-colons missing. This was easily fixed by adding them and now the validator is showing that there is no errors.

### Responsivness Test.

* The responsive design has been testet with <a href= "https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/">Google Chrome DevTools</a> and passes all the screen sizes.

### Known Bugs

* There were two error messages due to a style link in the head section, but when you moved it to its proper location, both error messages disappeared. So problem is solved and there are no bugs left.
